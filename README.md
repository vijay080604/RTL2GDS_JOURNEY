## 🌟 About This Repo
This repository documents my learning and hands-on work during the **20-week RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**.  
The program takes us from **RTL → GDSII** using only **open-source tools**.  
My goal is to document everything in a clean, interactive way so anyone can follow along.

---

## 🧭 Objectives
- 🚀 Learn the complete **ASIC flow** (RTL → GDSII)  
- 🔧 Master open-source tools like **Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, Netgen**  
- 📑 Maintain detailed notes, errors & fixes  
- 🌍 Share my progress with the VLSI community
